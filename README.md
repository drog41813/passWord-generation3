# passWord-generation3

## Description

This password generator includes an html and css file as well as a JS file that will ask a user with a pop-up window how many characters the user would like in their password. Once the user provides a number indicating how many characters they would like, the window will continue to initiate pop-ups that ask the user if they would like Uppercase/Lowercase letters, special, and numbers in their password. Once user has answered all the pop-ups shown, a password that fits all the requirements given by the user will show up within the password generator box.
